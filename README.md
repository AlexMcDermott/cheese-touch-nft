# Cheese Touch NFT

Inspired by the children's book Diary of a Wimpy Kid, the point of this NFT is not to have it. The idea is that only a single instance of the NFT will exist at any given time and will transferred between friends and co-workers like the game hot potato. The smart contract will track the total time each participant has held the token and I plan to make a website to interact with it to display this information as a leaderboard.

## Attack Plan

- [x] Setup a repo with Hardhat
- [x] Write a basic NFT smart contract
- [x] Deploy to the Sepolia testnet
- [ ] Setup unit testing to develop the contract locally
- [ ] Make the contract upgradable
- [ ] Implement token hold time tracking
- [ ] Make a contract call from a web app
- [ ] Create a leaderboard to display tracked time

### Nice to Haves

- [ ] Make the contract upgradeable
- [ ] Use the [NFT Storage API](https://nft.storage/docs/client/js/) to automatically upload NFT assets and acquire IPFS addresses at build time
